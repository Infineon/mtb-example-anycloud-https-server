# AnyCloud: HTTPS Server

This code example demonstrates the implementation of an HTTPS server with PSoC® 6 MCU and CYW43xxx connectivity devices.

It employs the [HTTPS Server](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/http-server) middleware library, which takes care of all the underlying socket connections with the HTTPS client. In this example, the HTTPS server establishes a secure connection with an HTTPS client through SSL handshake. Once the SSL handshake completes successfully, the HTTPS client can make GET, POST, and PUT requests with the server.

## Requirements

- [ModusToolbox® software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment) v2.2

    **Note:** This code example version requires ModusToolbox software version 2.2 or later and is not backward compatible with v2.1 or older versions. If you cannot move to ModusToolbox v2.2, use the latest compatible version of this example: [latest-v1.X](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-anycloud-https-server/tree/latest-v1.X).

## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

- Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).
- [OpenSSL](#prerequisites)

**Note:** This code example also uses the *cURL* utility to test the HTTPS server. This utility helps to send HTTPS GET, POST, and PUT requests to the server. The *cURL* utility (version 7.59.0) is already shipped with the ModusToolbox software v2.2; it is available under *{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell/bin*).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

    For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open *secure_http_server.h* and modify the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY_TYPE` macros to match the credentials of the Wi-Fi network that you want to connect to.

   All possible security types are defined in the `cy_wcm_security_t` structure in the *cy_wcm.h* file.

3. Because this code example uses a self-signed SSL certificate, you need to generate the certificates required by the HTTPS server and client so that they can successfully establish a secure HTTPS connection. Follow the steps provided in a [separate section](#creating-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate) which explains how to generate the certificates.

4. Open the *source/secure_keys.h* file and do the following:

   1. Modify `keySERVER_CERTIFICATE_PEM` with contents from the *mysecurehttpserver.local.crt* file generated in Step 3.
   2. Modify `keySERVER_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` with contents from the *mysecurehttpserver.local.key* file generated in Step 3.
   3. Modify `keyCLIENT_ROOTCA_PEM` with contents from the *rootCA.crt* file generated in Step 3.

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

6. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
        ```
        make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
        ```

        Example:
        ```
        make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
        ```

        **Note:** Before building the application, ensure that the *deps* folder contains the BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.lib*) corresponding to the TARGET. Execute the `make getlibs` command to fetch the BSP contents before building the application.

7. After programming, the application starts automatically. Verify that the following logs appear on the serial terminal:

   ```
   Info: ===================================

   ```

8. The client needs to install *rootCA.crt* to trust the HTTPS website and its own certificate *mysecurehttpclient.pfx*. The *.pfx file bundles the client certificate and key in PKCS format.

   Do the following to install the certificates on the client machine. In this code example, the HTTPS server has two types of clients: one uses the cURL utility while the other uses a web browser.

    - **cURL utility:**

        - Ensure that the *cURL* utility has access to the *rootCA.crt*, *mysecurehttpclient.crt*, and *mysecurehttpclient.key* files generated in Step 3. cURL commands can be invoked from anywhere in the modus-shell. The command takes the argument such as `--cacert`, `--cert`, and `--key`, which indicates the file path to *rootCA.crt*, *mysecurehttpclient.crt*, and *mysecurehttpclient.key* respectively.

    - **Web browser:**

        - ***Mozilla Firefox:***
            1. Select **Options** > **Privacy & Security** (Windows) or **Preferences** > **Privacy & Security** (macOS and Ubuntu).
            2. Find the **Certificates** section and then click **View Certificates**.

               The browser displays the Certificate Manager dialog.

            3. Click **Import** and select the *rootCA.crt* file generated in Step 3 and click **Open**.

            4. Trust this certificate authority to identify websites and email users and click **OK**.

               The *rootCA.crt* is now installed.

            5. Similarly, import the client certificate *mysecurehttpclient.pfx* under **Your Certificates** on the Certificate Manager window. The certificate was generated with empty password; therefore, lea]ve it empty if it asks for a password during import.

        - ***Google Chrome and Internet Explorer on Windows:***

            1. In the  Run dialog (click **Win key + R**), type `certmgr.msc` and click **OK**.

               The Windows Certificate Manager application opens.

            2. Navigate to the *Trusted Root Certification Authorities/Certificates* folder.

            3. Go to **Action** > **All Tasks** > **Import** and click **Next**.

            4. Select the *rootCA.crt* file generated in Step 3. Make sure to change file type as **All Files** to find the *rootCA.crt* file. Click **Open**.

            5. Select the certification store as **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and click **Finish**.

            6. Click **Yes** to the security warning window to acknowledge that you trust *rootCA.crt* to allow its websites and email users.

               The **rootCA.crt** is now installed.

        - ***Google Chrome (Ubuntu):***

            1. Select **Settings**  > **Show Advanced Settings** > **HTTPS/SSL**. Click **Manage Certificates** under the **Security** tab.

            2. In the Certificate Manager window, click **Import** under the **Authorities** tab.

            3. Select the *rootCA.crt* file generated in step 3. Make sure to change file type as **All Files** to find the *rootCA.crt* file. Click **Open**.

            4. Trust this certificate authority to identify websites and email users and click **OK**.

               The *rootCA.crt* is now installed.

            5. Similarly, import the client certificate *mysecurehttpclient.pfx* under the **Personal** category.

        - ***Google Chrome (macOS):***
            1. Open **Finder** > **Applications** > **Utilities** > **Keychain Access**.

            2. Select the **System** keychain.

            3. Open **File** > **Import Items**, and import the certificate file *rootCA.crt* into the **System** keychain.

            4. Right-click the certificate and select **Get Info**.

               A certificate information window appears.

            5. Expand the **Trust** category and select **Always Trust** to trust this certificate authority.

            6. Similarly, import the client certificate *mysecurehttpclient.pfx* under **MyCertificates** category. The certificate was generated with empty password; therefore, leave it empty if it asks for a password.

        **Notes:**
        - Browsers might need a restart after importing the certificate.

        - When importing the *mysecurehttpclient.pfx* file, the Chrome browser asks the user to set the **CryptoAPI Private Key** to protect the client certificate key from accessing it by the browser. The browser is given access to the client private key only after entering the correct key and **allowing** access by the user.

9. Ensure that your PC is connected to the same Wi-Fi access point that you have configured in Step 2.

10. Enter `https://mysecurehttpserver.local:50007` in the web browser to access the HTTPS server webpage.


## Test the HTTPS Server

### Using Web Browser:

1. Enter the URL `https://mysecurehttpserver.local:50007`. This opens the HTML page; it will look like as follows:

   **Figure 1. HTTPS Web Page**

   ![](images/webpage.png)

2. Click **Get LED status** to send an HTTPS `GET` command to the server running on the kit.

   The server returns the current LED status on the kit as a response. Note that entering the URL itself will send a `GET` command to the server to get the HTML page.

3. Click **Toggle LED** to send an HTTPS `POST` command to the server running on the kit.

   The server acts on the command request and toggles the LED on the kit.

### Using the cURL Utility:

1. Open modus-shell (*{ModusToolbox install directory}/tools_\<version>/modus-shell/Cygwin.bat*).

2. Set the path to *rootCA.crt*, *mysecurehttpclient.crt*, and *mysecurehttpclient.key* in a variable.

   ```
   PATH_TO_ROOTCA="<Path to rootCA.crt file>"
   ```

   ```
   PATH_TO_CLIENT_CRT="<Path to mysecurehttpclient.crt file>"
   ```

   ```
   PATH_TO_CLIENT_KEY="<Path to mysecurehttpclient.key file>"
   ```

3. Set the path to HTTPS web page URL in a variable.

   ```
   HTTPS_SERVER_URL="https://mysecurehttpserver.local:50007"
   ```
   where `mysecurehttpserver.local` is the HTTPS server domain name; `50007` is the HTTPS port number defined in the *secure_http_server.h* file in the `HTTPS_PORT` macro.

4. Use the following *cURL* commands to test HTTPS commands with the HTTPS server:

   1. **HTTPS GET:** Get the kit's LED status (ON or OFF).

      ```
      curl --cacert $PATH_TO_ROOTCA --cert $PATH_TO_CLIENT_CRT --key $PATH_TO_CLIENT_KEY -X GET $HTTPS_SERVER_URL --output -
      ```

   2. Verify that the HTTPS server responds with the following HTML output. This contains the LED status (ON or OFF) of the kit.

      ```
      <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>HTTPS Server Demo</title></head><body><h1>HTTPS Server Demo</h1><form method="get"><fieldset><legend>HTTPS GET</legend><input type="submit" value="Get LED status"/><input type="text" name="led_status" value="OFF" size="3" readonly/></br></br></fieldset></br></form><form method="post"><fieldset><legend>HTTPS POST</legend><input type="submit" name="toggle_led" value="Toggle LED"/></br></br></fieldset></br></form></body></html>
      ```

   3. **HTTPS POST:** Toggle the LED (ON or OFF) on the kit.

      ```
      curl --cacert $PATH_TO_ROOTCA --cert $PATH_TO_CLIENT_CRT --key $PATH_TO_CLIENT_KEY -X POST $HTTPS_SERVER_URL --output -
      ```

   4. Verify that the HTTPS server responds with the following HTML output. The response contains the LED status (ON or OFF) of the last `GET` request.

      ```
      <!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>HTTPS Server Demo</title></head><body><h1>HTTPS Server Demo</h1><form method="get"><fieldset><legend>HTTPS GET</legend><input type="submit" value="Get LED status"/><input type="text" name="led_status" value="OFF" size="3" readonly/></br></br></fieldset></br></form><form method="post"><fieldset><legend>HTTPS POST</legend><input type="submit" name="toggle_led" value="Toggle LED"/></br></br></fieldset></br></form></body></html>
      ```

   5. **HTTPS PUT:** Register a new HTTP resource. The HTTPS server creates a new resource called *myhellomessage*.

      ```
      curl --cacert $PATH_TO_ROOTCA --cert $PATH_TO_CLIENT_CRT --key $PATH_TO_CLIENT_KEY -X PUT -d "/myhellomessage=Hello!" $HTTPS_SERVER_URL --output -
      ```

   6. Verify the newly created resource by sending an HTTPS `GET` request.

      ```
      curl --cacert $PATH_TO_ROOTCA --cert $PATH_TO_CLIENT_CRT --key $PATH_TO_CLIENT_KEY -X GET $HTTPS_SERVER_URL/myhellomessage --output -
      ```
   7. Verify that the HTTPS server responds with a 'Hello' text message.

      ```
      Hello!
      ```

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Known Issues
1. We have seen an issue with mDNS when the device joins with Home Access Point. The console logs are shown below. Few AP models with which we have observed this issue are D-Link DIR-816 and TP-Link Archer C20. So we recommend you to connect the kit to a mobile hotspot if the device reports the below error when joining the AP.

   ```
   Info: Wi-Fi initialization is successful
   Info: Join to AP: WIFI_SSID
   Function whd_wifi_unregister_multicast_address failed at line 2834    checkres = 101580800
   Received buffer request ID: 42 (expectation: 42)
   whd_cdc_send_ioctl is already timed out, drop the buffer
   ```

2. The HTTPS server does not request for the client certificate when establishing secure HTTP connection.

These issues will be addressed in a future update of this code example.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

The following ModusToolbox resources are used in this example.

**Table 1. Application Resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL) |cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port |
| GPIO (HAL) | CYBSP_USER_LED | User LED |

This example uses the Arm® Cortex®-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC 6 MCU to start the HTTPS server task. At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep.

In this example, the HTTPS server establishes a secure connection with a web browser or cURL client through SSL handshake. During the SSL handshake, the server presents its SSL certificate for verification, and verifies the incoming client identity. This example uses mDNS (Multicast Domain Name System) provided by the lwIP open-source TCP/IP network stack. mDNS helps in resolving the domain name of the HTTPS server to an IP address in the local network. This code example supports only IPv4 with mDNS.

You can define the maximum number of HTTPS page resources for the HTTPS server in the application Makefile, as shown below. The HTTPS server library maintains the database of pages based on this value.

```
DEFINES+=MAX_NUMBER_OF_HTTP_SERVER_RESOURCES=10
```

Note that if the `MAX_NUMBER_OF_HTTP_SERVER_RESOURCES` value is not defined in the application Makefile, the HTTPS server will set it to 10 by default. This code example does not define this parameter in the application Makefile; therefore, the application uses the default value of 10. This depends on the availability of memory on the MCU device.

### Creating a Self-Signed SSL Certificate

The HTTPS server demonstrated in this example uses a self-signed SSL certificate. This means that there is no third-party certificate issuing authority, commonly referred to as CA, involved in the authentication of the server. Clients connecting to the server must have a root CA certificate to verify and trust the websites defined by the certificate. Only when the client trusts the website, it can establish secure connection with the HTTPS server.

Do the following to generate a self-signed SSL certificate:

#### Prerequisites

The OpenSSL library is required to generate a self-signed certificate for the HTTPS server.

1. Run the following command in your local environment to see if you already have OpenSSL installed.

   ```
   which openssl
   ```

2. Install OpenSSL if the `which` command does not return a path.

| Operating System  |  Installation    |
| :------- | :------------    |
| Windows | [Windows OpenSSL installer](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/openssl.htm) |
| Ubuntu Linux |`apt-get install openssl`|
| macOS |[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):`brew install openssl`|

#### Generate SSL Certificate and Private Key

Run the following script to generate the self-signed SSL certificate and private key.

   Before invoking the following command, modify the `OPENSSL_SUBJECT_INFO` macro in the *generate_ssl_certs.sh* file to match your local domain configuration such as  *Country*, *State*, *Locality*, *Organization*, *Organization Unit name*, and *Common Name*. This macro is used by the *openssl* commands when generating the certificate.

```
./generate_ssl_certs.sh
```

This will produce the following files:

File                           | Description
-------------------------------|------------
*mysecurehttpserver.local.crt* | HTTPS server certificate
*mysecurehttpserver.local.key* | HTTPS server private key
*rootCA.crt* | HTTPS server rootCA certificate to trust the client
*rootCA.key* | HTTPS server root key used for signing the certificate
*mysecurehttpclient.crt* | HTTPS client certificate
*mysecurehttpclient.key* | HTTPS client key
*mysecurehttpclient.pfx* | Bundles the HTTPS client certificate and key in PKCS12 format

The HTTPS server should be configured to take *mysecurehttpserver.local.crt* as the certificate, *mysecurehttpserver.local.key* as the private key, and *rootCA.crt* as the rootCA certificate.

You can either convert the values to strings manually following the format shown in *source/secure_keys.h* or use the HTML utility available [here](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/amazon-freertos/blob/master/tools/certificate_configuration/PEMfileToCString.html) to convert the certificates and keys from PEM format to C string format. You need to clone the repository from GitHub to use the utility.

The *rootCA.crt* and *mysecurehttpclient.pfx* should be installed on the web browser clients which are trying to communicate with the HTTPS server. With *cURL*, the *rootCA.crt*, *mysecurehttpclient.crt*, and *mysecurehttpclient.key* can be passed as command-line arguments.
